# PSPM Pitch - Quick Reference & Talking Points

## 🎤 Opening Pitch (60 seconds)

"Today, B2B procurement is fragmented and inefficient. Companies use 5+ platforms just to source products, manage inventory, and track shipments. We're building PSPM—a unified B2B marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, streamlines procurement workflows, and provides real-time visibility into operations.

We've already built a production-ready MVP with enterprise-grade security, audit trails, and SaaS-ready architecture. We're looking to raise $2M to scale go-to-market and build out the remaining features.

The global B2B market is $7+ trillion. We're targeting mid-market companies who are willing to pay premium prices for simplicity and intelligence. Our projections show $50M ARR by year 3."

## 🎯 Answer Common Questions

### "Why now?"
"Three trends converging:
1. **Supply chain digitization** - COVID showed companies need real-time visibility
2. **SMB tech adoption** - Companies now expect cloud-first solutions
3. **Vendor fatigue** - Mid-market tired of expensive, inflexible ERPs"

### "Who's the customer?"
"Mid-market companies (50-5000 employees) with:
- Multiple procurement teams
- Complex vendor networks
- Need for real-time visibility
- Budget for software ($500K-$5M annually)

Examples: Manufacturing, Distribution, Retail, Construction"

### "What's your competitive advantage?"
"Three things:
1. **User Experience** - Modern UI vs clunky ERPs
2. **Speed** - Deploy in hours vs 6-month ERP implementations
3. **Architecture** - Built for SaaS from day 1 vs bolt-on tools"

### "Why should we believe you can execute?"
"We've already built:
- Secure authentication with RBAC
- Complete audit trail (compliance)
- Multi-tenant isolation (SaaS-ready)
- API service layer (backend-ready)
- Error handling (production-grade)

This is all in production-ready code with full TypeScript and enterprise patterns."

### "What's the go-to-market strategy?"
"Three phases:
1. **Phase 1 (Months 0-6)**: Land 10-20 pilot customers, get case studies
2. **Phase 2 (Months 6-12)**: Scale sales with established success stories
3. **Phase 3 (Year 2+)**: Self-service + mid-market sales team

Channel: Direct sales to procurement leaders + Partner resellers"

### "How will you spend the $2M?"
"
- **Engineering** (40%): $800K - Build out features, scale platform
- **Infrastructure** (20%): $400K - Cloud costs, AI/ML APIs, security
- **Marketing** (20%): $400K - Content, events, paid ads, partnerships
- **Operations** (15%): $300K - Legal, accounting, admin, hiring
- **Buffer** (5%): $100K - Contingency"

### "What are the risks?"
"Be honest:
1. **Competition** - Well-funded players (but we're faster and better UX)
2. **Sales** - B2B sales is hard (but we're starting with warm outreach)
3. **Execution** - Building all 9 modules is ambitious (but core architecture done)
4. **Customer churn** - Need to deliver ROI fast (but design prioritizes user success)

Mitigation: Start with 1-2 modules, get ROI, then expand"

### "Can you do this with less funding?"
"Yes, but slower:
- **$2M**: 1-year aggressive growth
- **$1M**: 18-month sustainable growth
- **$500K**: Bootstrap to profitability in 3 years

We prefer speed but can execute either way."

## 📊 Demo Talking Points

### "Let me show you the authentication system"
"We built enterprise-grade security:
- Multi-company support (SaaS architecture)
- 5 user roles with granular permissions
- Session persistence (auto-login after refresh)
- Complete audit trail of every action
- Error handling so the app never crashes"

### "Here's the dashboard"
"This is where users land:
- Real-time stats (orders, revenue, inventory)
- Quick access to 9 major modules
- Responsive design (works mobile + desktop)
- Notification system with persistent storage"

### "Security and compliance"
"Show audit logs:"
- Every login/logout logged
- Searchable by user, action, date
- Export to CSV for auditors
- Ready for SOC 2 compliance

This is critical for enterprise buyers."

### "The architecture"
"We've built with enterprise patterns:
- Zustand for state management (lightweight, fast)
- Axios with interceptors (logging, auth injection)
- Error boundaries (prevents crashes)
- Multi-tenant isolation (data security)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Full separation of concerns (services)"

## 💬 Sample Responses to Objections

### "We love the idea but the market is crowded"
"There are big players (SAP, Oracle) but they're slow and expensive. There are niche players (single-function tools). No one is doing an integrated B2B platform with great UX at accessible pricing. The market is consolidating around winners—we want to be that."

### "B2B sales are hard"
"You're right. But we're starting with warm outreach to procurement leaders we know. If we can land 10 customers at $50K ARR each with 80% net retention, we've proven the model. Then we can hire a sales team."

### "What if AWS/Shopify builds this?"
"Possible. But they move slow and we're moving fast. By the time they consider this, we'll have 500 customers and defensible moats (switching costs, integrations). We'd also be an acquisition target."

### "How do you differentiate from legacy ERPs?"
"They're clunky, expensive, and take 6 months to implement. We're modern UX, $50/user/month, deployed in hours. For mid-market that's a 10x better experience and ROI in 3 months instead of 12."

### "Customer acquisition looks expensive"
"It is. But our LTV is $50K+ based on mid-market ACV. At CAC of $1000-2000, we have 25:1 LTV:CAC ratio—very healthy. Payback is 6-9 months."
