MEDAH 1.0

 I need you to install any extensions any features that would be needed and to let me know if we need to get more services from firebase in terms of cloud hosting messaging from firebase etc let me tell you exactly the app you are supposed to build. Firstly install AI from fire and any other ai that we might need for the following that will help the application in terms of building models for storage warehousing and getting automatic generated images on products which are uploaded to the application in bulk using Excel, this a sales a procurement market place type app for business to buy, and sell there products with an invetory section and warehouse 2d funtion to track where each product is stored the warehouse, and combined with transport system to track goods sold, a teats section for directors to view analytics, with muiltple uses per company or business, and filter to only search for companies, or indivdiald, an inquriy, quote and order making system between buyer and seller,so that they can Inquire by searching for goods or inquire by directly searching for a company or an individual who is registered to the application and start the process of procurement once they send the inquiry the seller receives the inquiry and is prompted to respond with a quotation if they have the good in stock once the response has been received they seller sends it back to the buyer to which they can respond with an order In real time, Each company or individual has got the provision to put their goods or services up for display into their inventory and there is a prompt where they can place the goods onto the market for everyone to see but the inventory is private only visible by the owner or the people which are assigned to that email under the admin for example sales manager procurement officer etc Artifacture that allows the user when adding goods to the inventory to add the goods in bulk using an Excel spreadsheet and let AI have a look at it so it can add it into the inventory to avoid different formats not loading the goods into the inventory also implement a cart system from the search of the marketplace on every product they should be add to cart prompt, Also a section where vendors can be saved for quick business maneuverability And on the cart they should be a pick vendor Segment if you are selling, But not when you are buying make it different the seller sees pick vendor and the buyer doesn't, Add a setting code inventory best line which ones the owner of the product when the quantity drops below a certain number, Add an inn up notification system when an inquiry has been received order and quotation and so on add analytics to show which goods are being sold the most and all other analytic information, Make it so that people can The able communicate with each other within the teams of the company for example the director can give out an order or he can make a request and also that other segments of the company can send requests out to the procurement section add an HR Department as well as to track the time book salary deadline employee salaries and everything involved with hour and also a provision for company documents and their expiry date with its function in up that warns the users of the app who are assigned to a row to make sure those documents are always renewed I don't know what to call them you should know that In the hour department there should be employee contracts initiation of employment length of contract and also when it will expire with a warning when the contracts left with one month of expiry showing prompts renew unsure let go and also a segment for posting job offerings for individuals who are looking for jobs companies should be able to post their job openings there as individuals can now search a keyword for example engineer or driver and that should link to the company's postings they should show experience needed field of work etc everything needed for job postings add that too Also company vehicle monitoring location systems due a system that will show when a new spare part was put into a truck for example average minutes or average distance before replacement and this should show a warning when it surpasses that time or distance this would be tracked through the tracking system, lastly make the app look professional and neat keep everything tidy do not over populate the dashboard pack everything in bigger folders and let it have dropped down abilities as there are a lot of features. Feel free to add any other sector that you might see is missing in order to run a company successfully, maybe the accounting? sector just a hint. add them all
