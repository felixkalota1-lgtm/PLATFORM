## ⏱️ THE 60-SECOND PITCH

**Practice this until you can say it perfectly from memory.**

---

### **Standard Investor Version** (60 seconds)

> "We're building the modern B2B marketplace for small and medium enterprises. Traditional platforms like Alibaba and our regional competitors don't understand SME workflows. They're clunky, they're expensive at $100+ per user, and they require months of implementation.
>
> We're solving this with a modern, role-based platform with built-in compliance, multi-tenant architecture, and a 9-module suite covering procurement, inventory, logistics, HR, and accounting—everything a B2B business needs.
>
> We're targeting a $50 SaaS subscription per user. Our competitive advantage is 80% faster setup than legacy ERP, enterprise-grade security from day one, and a 60% lower cost.
>
> We're starting with procurement and logistics, where we've identified a TAM of $12 billion across our target geography. Our roadmap is customer acquisition in Month 2, Series Seed in Month 6, and $50M ARR by Year 3.
>
> We're raising $500K today to accelerate product development and go-to-market."

>
> We're solving the procurement and logistics problem. Could I show you what it looks like?"

## 💡 THE KEY MESSAGING PILLARS

### **Pillar 1: The Problem** 📊
> "SMEs waste $40k+ per year on expensive ERP that takes 3+ months to implement. They need something modern, affordable, and fast. The market doesn't have it yet."

### **Pillar 2: Our Solution** 💡
> "A modern, role-based B2B marketplace with built-in compliance, multi-tenant architecture, and 9 integrated modules. Deploy in days, not months."

### **Pillar 3: Market Size** 📈
> "$12 billion TAM in our target geography alone. Mostly underserved by legacy vendors."

### **Pillar 4: Business Model** 💰
> "SaaS subscription: $50/user/month. 5x cheaper than competitors. Targets: SMEs with 20-500 employees."

### **Pillar 5: Competitive Advantage** 🚀
> "1. 80% faster setup  2. 60% lower cost  3. Enterprise security from day one  4. Modern UX  5. Built for SMEs, not enterprises"

## ❓ TOP 10 INVESTOR QUESTIONS + ANSWERS

### **Q1: Why now? What changed?**

**Answer**: 
"Three things converged: First, SME digital transformation budgets increased 40% post-COVID. Second, low-code platforms made it feasible to build what was previously enterprise-only. Third, there's now proof of concept with companies like Faire and TradeKey raising $100M+ in B2B marketplace space.

Our timing is perfect—the market is ready for a modern, affordable alternative."

---

### **Q2: How is this different from Alibaba?**

**Answer**:
"Alibaba dominates international trade, but they don't understand local SME workflows. They're built for large-scale trading, not day-to-day operations.

We're solving the operational side: procurement workflows, inventory tracking, logistics coordination, compliance logging. Think less 'marketplace', more 'operating system for B2B operations'.

Our wedge is procurement + logistics where we can solve pain points Alibaba ignores."

---

### **Q3: How is this different from SAP/Oracle?**

**Answer**:
"Legacy ERP is enterprise-first. Expensive, hard to implement, requires technical expertise. Perfect for Fortune 500. Wrong for SMEs.

Our approach:
- $50/user vs $100-300/user
- 2 weeks to live vs 3-6 months
- Cloud-based, no IT required
- Modern interface built in 2025, not 1995

We're not competing with SAP. We're going after customers too small for SAP, too frustrated with spreadsheets."

---

### **Q4: What's the business model?**

**Answer**:
"SaaS subscription model:
- Tier 1: $50/user/month for up to 100 users ($5-50K MRR)
- Tier 2: $35/user/month for 100-500 users ($3.5-175K MRR)
- Tier 3: Custom pricing for 500+ users

Payment Terms: Annual upfront with 30-day trial, 97% net retention due to multi-department usage."

---

### **Q5: Who's your customer?**

**Answer**:
"Primary: Manufacturing and trading companies with 20-500 employees who currently use fragmented solutions (spreadsheets, multiple vendors' tools, manual processes).

Geographic focus: Southeast Asia initially (India, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam) due to:
1. High SME density (15M+ companies)
2. Limited ERP options
3. Lower price sensitivity to Western solutions
4. High English proficiency

Secondary: Logistics companies, procurement teams at mid-market companies."

---

### **Q6: How will you acquire customers?**

**Answer**:
"Multi-pronged approach:

Month 1-3: Direct outreach to procurement managers at 200+ SMEs ($0 CAC)
Month 3-6: Sales team (2 people) targeting industry associations
Month 6+: Partner with logistics providers for integration/referral ($2K-5K CAC)
Month 9+: Freemium tier to drive organic signups

Conservative CAC estimate: $3-5K per customer
LTV: $60K+ (assuming 3-year lifetime at $50/user/month with 5 users average)
LTV:CAC ratio: 12:1 (healthy unit economics)"

---

### **Q7: What's your go-to-market timeline?**

**Answer**:
"Month 1: Polish MVP, customer interviews, feature prioritization
Month 2-3: First 5 paying customers, refine based on feedback
Month 4-6: Scale to 50 customers ($100K MRR), hire sales person
Month 6-9: Series Seed fundraising, team scaling
Month 9-12: Hit $500K MRR, launch second market

Key milestones for Series A:
- $1M ARR by Month 12
- 20+ enterprise customers
- 40% MoM growth
- Proof of 90%+ net retention"

---

### **Q8: What are the risks?**

**Answer**:
"Major risks and mitigation:

Risk 1: Execution - We might not build fast enough
Mitigation: Experienced team, modular architecture, clear roadmap

Risk 2: Market - SMEs might not be ready for SaaS
Mitigation: Proven by Zoho, ServiceTitan, and others. Already have customer interest

Risk 3: Competition - Larger players might enter
Mitigation: Speed to market, customer lock-in through integrations, superior UX

Risk 4: Unit economics - Sales might be harder than expected
Mitigation: Starting with high-touch sales, partner channel proven in similar markets

Risk 5: Retention - Customers might churn
Mitigation: Multi-department usage increases stickiness, strong NPS is goal"

---

### **Q9: What do you need the $500K for?**

**Answer**:
"Allocation:
- Product Development (40%): $200K - 2 engineers for 6 months
- Sales & Marketing (35%): $175K - Sales person, customer acquisition
- Operations (15%): $75K - Legal, compliance, infrastructure
- Runway (10%): $50K - Buffer for contingencies

This gets us to $100K MRR and Series Seed conversation. After that, revenue funds growth."

---

### **Q10: What's the exit strategy?**

**Answer**:
"Three paths:

Path 1 (Most likely): IPO at $500M+ valuation within 5-7 years (following Shopify, Cloudflare model)

Path 2: Strategic acquisition by larger SaaS player (SAP, Zoho, Infor) at $200-300M

Path 3: Profitable private company generating $50M+ ARR

All paths are achievable given market size and growth trajectory."

## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### **Objection 1: "We already have a vendor for this"**

**Response**:
"I understand. Most do. But here's the difference:

What are you paying per user? [Listen]
How long did implementation take? [Listen]
Are you happy with it? [Listen]

Most companies I talk to are paying 2-3x what they need to for something built for enterprises, not them. They'd switch for 50% lower cost + better UX. Can I show you what's possible in 10 minutes?"

---

### **Objection 2: "Your platform is too new"**

**Response**:
"That's fair. But think about it: Would you rather wait for us to have 100 customers before you sign up, or be customer #10 and get white-glove support and custom features built for your workflow?

Our first customers are getting:
- 3x faster implementation
- 2x lower cost
- Direct access to the product team
- Prioritized feature development

Most wait. The ones who don't get the most value. What would move the needle for you?"

---

### **Objection 3: "Pricing seems high"**

**Response**:
"Let me flip this: What are you paying your ERP vendor now?

[They say $100-300 per user]

We're $50/user. So if you have 50 users, that's $30k vs $150-300k annually. Plus you're live in 2 weeks instead of 3 months.

That's not high pricing. That's a 70% discount on cost plus 3 months of productivity gained. That's a 4-month payback on what you're saving."

---

### **Objection 4: "How do I know you won't go out of business?"**

**Response**:
"Valid question. Here's what we offer:

1. Data export: All your data exports to CSV/JSON anytime
2. Roadmap transparency: You see exactly what we're building
3. Enterprise SLA: Data backups, redundancy, 99.9% uptime
4. Customer priority: You have a seat at the product table

Also: We've raised capital from experienced investors who do diligence on this. We're not bootstrapped and hoping. We're funded with a clear path to profitability.

Would a 30-day trial address your concern?"

---

### **Objection 5: "We need custom development"**

**Response**:
"Most do at first. Here's what typically happens:

You think you need custom. But often, you just need time to adapt your process to how modern software works. That's a different problem than custom dev.

What we can do:
- 30 days of free onboarding and configuration
- Custom fields and automation (no code)
- Integrations with your existing tools
- True custom dev only after we've optimized for standard config

Shall we do a 2-week pilot to see what's actually needed?"

---

## 📊 DEMO SCRIPT

**Total time: 8-10 minutes**

### **Setup (1 minute)**
"Let me show you the platform. It's live at [URL]. I've created a demo company with sample data so you can see how it works for procurement and logistics."

### **Demo Section 1: Login & Dashboard (2 minutes)**
"First, authentication. This is role-based. [Log in as Admin] See the dashboard—this is what a procurement manager sees. [Point to modules] We support 9 modules. Today focusing on Procurement and Logistics."

### **Demo Section 2: Procurement Module (3 minutes)**
"In procurement, you manage RFQs. [Click module] This is where you create inquiries and see quotes. Each vendor can submit via the platform or email. You score them automatically based on price, delivery time, quality rating. [Show features] Built-in compliance logging—every action is recorded for audit."

### **Demo Section 3: Multi-Tenant (1 minute)**
"Different companies see different data. [Show in app] Company A can't see Company B's data. Critical for security. [Point to audit log] Complete audit trail for compliance."

### **Demo Section 4: Role-Based Access (1 minute)**
"I'm Admin. I see everything. [Log out] [Log in as Manager] Manager sees only their department. [Vendors] can only see inquiries sent to them. Built-in compliance with role definitions."

### **Demo Section 5: Mobile (1 minute)**
"Works on mobile too. [Show on phone] You can manage procurement from anywhere."

### **Closing (1 minute)**
"So to recap: Modern interface, built-in compliance, role-based access, 80% faster than legacy platforms, 60% cheaper. Can be live in 2 weeks. Questions?"
